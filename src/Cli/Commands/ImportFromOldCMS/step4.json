People loved it, he added it to the menu, and not long after, Americans brought the recipe to San Francisco.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebuenavista.com\/home\/home.html\">The Buena Vista<\/a> ~ The origin of Irish coffee in America. \u201cThe historic venture started on the night of November the 10th in 1952. Jack Koeppler, then-owner of the Buena Vista, challenged international travel writer Stanton Delaplane to help re-create a highly touted \"Irish Coffee\" served at Shannon Airport in Ireland.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chowhound.com\/recipes\/irish-coffee-29420\">Another recipe from Chowhound<\/a> ~ Joe referenced this recipe in today\u2019s episode.

Do we, though?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact of the matter is, everyone says that coffee has a lot of acid and that it causes health problems. Even your taxi driver can offer advice like \u2018Stay off of caffeine and coffee because it\u2019ll eat a hole in your brain and your stomach\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We strongly encourage you to not take hearsay advice. When everyone\u2019s saying something, but no one knows the scientific evidence to support the claim, you would be better off to question what people are saying. \u2018Coffee will upset your stomach because it has harmful acids\u2019 is such a statement that gets around that no one has support for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact of the matter is that coffee doesn\u2019t directly cause a stomachache because of high amounts of coffee-related acids, and we know this from scientifically accurate research available today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many other examples of such hearsay concerns, like\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are we drinking too much water?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody really knows, eh? I mean, there was that guy that once warned Joe that \u2018You can drink too much water and flush out your lightbulbs\u2019. That sounds really bad, doesn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that you should drink enough water to be hydrated and stop, right? Some doctors recommend more, some recommend less. No one recommends abstaining from water, and no one recommends that you abstain from water when you\u2019re thirsty. Drink enough that you\u2019re not feeling faint or disoriented. Drink enough that you aren\u2019t taking too many trips to the restroom, but you\u2019re at least making a few trips to the restroom each day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Point is: Some people need more water and some need less. Our children don\u2019t warrant drinking two liters of fluids a day, but we grown-ups do. It\u2019s a matter of how much will it take to survive and improve the quality of my life? When you\u2019ve reached the point that you\u2019re not pale from dehydration, you\u2019re probably all set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we really want to know: What are our lightbulbs and how can we prevent flushing them out???<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do we need to worry about molds and pesticides?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019 been scares for what happens to coffee beans on the plants, what happens to them on the farm during processing, and so forth. We used to think that you had to be careful of pesticides, molds and other contaminants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that during roasting most of the cruft that can be in or on the beans is baked off into a vapor. \u201cThey\u2019re subjected to an insane amount of heat,\u201d Eric explains. You needn't worry about molds surviving the cooking (roasting) process. Pesticides become inert or vaporize as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are we saying it\u2019s healthy to consume whatever else is left in the beans? No, but what we are saying is that toxins and germs and molds and the like (all harmul somehow) are in trace amounts in the air, water and other consumables that you\u2019re exposed to every day. There\u2019s not more of them in your coffee than in your eggs you had for breakfast, or in the water you drank yesterday at the office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contamenants in some amount are regularly making their way into your bloodstream no matter what you do. What are you going to do about it? We suggest that you keep drinking coffee in spite of pesticides or molds that might be present. And we also suggest you keep breathing the polluted air, because there isn\u2019t any air that doesn\u2019t have some trace amount of something bad for you to breath in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do we need to worry about caffeine overdose?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people think that you can consume so much caffeine that it will cause permanent damage to their organs, but this is not really the case.<br \/><br \/>Again, this comes up because of hearsay. People hear that caffeine is bad for them from their parents when they\u2019re young. Of course your parents told you not to drink coffee then because they wanted you to get some sleep at night before school the next day. They told you that too much caffeine was bad for you, and you figured that they had medical reasons for using caffeine in moderation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, you grew up thinking that this was scientifically supported, that it\u2019s possible to consume enough caffeine that it can handicap or kill people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, Science has proven that it would take more caffeine than you\u2019re physically capable of maintaining in your bloodstream to cause irreparable damage. You\u2019ll pee most of it before your biologically screwed up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Isn\u2019t coffee acid irritating my stomach?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend that you read Monica\u2019s article for a detailed explanation. To sum up, coffee acids will not hurt you or upset your stomach anymore than other fruits and vegetables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coffee usually grows in a warm tropic environment. It has a similar pH level to carrots and bananas. The worst coffee beans have a pH level of 4.7, which is the same as most bananas. Are you worried about the acid in bananas hurting your stomach? Probably not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a quick high school chemistry review, Eric says that, if his memory serves him, 7.0 is about the median of pH levels. The lower the number the higher the acid. A level of 1.0 would be very high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When coffee upsets your stomach, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s a high level of harmful acids in the beverage that cause stomachache.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gastric Acid versus Chlorogenic Acid<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gastric acid is the stuff your stomach produces all on its own. It\u2019s an essential part of digestion. When chlorogenic acids in your food and beverages are mixed with gastric acid, you experience a mild upset stomach which may lead to heartburn. The more the gastric acid is bonding to the chlorogenic acid from your beverages, the more upset you\u2019ll feel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NMP is an ingredient in coffee that can satiate the acids warring in your tummy. The more of it in the beans, the less irritated the digestion process will be. This is why some coffee will upset you more than others. The beans aren\u2019t all the same, and many of them have enough NMP to keep your stomach comfortable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, most coffee products don\u2019t identify how much chlorogenic acid or NMP they have, so you\u2019ll have to find alternative ways to dampen the problems your stomach juices are causing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Darker roasts help<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Medium roasted coffee has more of the chlorogenic acid than darker roasts. Roasting beans burns down all of the makeup of a coffee bean. This is a good thing because along the way the beans\u2019 molecular order shifts around. This produces their rich roated flavors. Without roasting, coffee beans taste very bland.<br \/><br \/>Roasting accentuates all flavors, including citric kinds. The flavor of acidity has little to do with the actual acid in the beans, but what\u2019s subduing the citric flavor in darker roasts is also reducing the chlorogenic acid. Less chlorogenic acid means less gastric acid irritation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lactose helps<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When in the Navy, Eric found that he was getting upset stomach. He attributed it to his coffee intake. Rather than drink less coffee, he chose to add milk to see if it would help settle his stomach. It took several days of new coffee with milk, but eventually his stomach stabalized.<br \/><br \/>Proteins found in dairy products bind with chlorogenic acid. When this happens, it\u2019s not possible for gastric acids to negatively react to coffee\u2019s acid. Your stomach remains settled and the coffee won\u2019t give you heartburn.<br \/><br \/>But in general, Eric was drinking too much coffee in the Navy. Like most officers do, with their arms frozen in The Coffee Mug By My Side position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cold brewing helps<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tis the season to drink coldbrew, and it will help your upset stomach. Coldbrew is a mild brew method. There isn\u2019t as much extraction from the beans.<br \/><br \/>This makes the coffee smoother, less acidic and less apt to upset your tummy. Use darker roasts with a coldbrew method and you\u2019ll be set. Or to make the coffee even less acidic, add some cream and there\u2019ll be next-to-no acid left to agitate your stomach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rabbit trail: Pepsi isn\u2019t a \u2018Southern Tradition\u2019<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric recently saw a banner ad for Pepsi claiming to be a southern thing. Sorry, Pepsi Cola Co., but none of us here in Georgia believe you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you\u2019ve fooled people that moved to Atlanta from New York in the last 20 years, but native Southerners know that Coca-Cola is headquartered in Atlanta and has been the backbone of the South for more than 100 years. And the Carolinas are known for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cheerwine.com\">Cheerwine<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>That said, Pepsi is proudly promoted on the side of Marietta\u2019s landmark that KFC calls <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_Chicken\">The Big Chicken<\/a>. It always struck us as odd that \u2018Pepsi\u2019 was written on the chicken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Another Rabbit trail: What\u2019s a Wordle?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A wordle is a collection of words that together describe a topic, business, or cultural trend. They\u2019re stacked in horizontal and vertical and diagonal ways, mixing up fonts and colors to make them look busier or more sophisticated, depending on the intent. Presenters often use wordles for word association.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can easily create your own at <a href=\"http:\/\/wordle.com\/\">Wordle.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gas Station Coffee<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thrasher Coffee is sponsoring our review of several coffees from around the world. So far, we\u2019ve taste tested beverages from restaurants, online subscriptions, and this week, we\u2019re adding local gas station\u2019s to the lineup. Uh, thanks a lot, Thrasher, we guess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>RaceTrac\u2019s Regular and Columbian (Bleh!)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have with us a cup of regular and a cup of Columbian brewed coffee from the local RaceTrac. Both were fresh, as they like to point out all over their cups (the wordles say so). We left our coffees black for the purposes of our taste test.<br \/><br \/>Like any gas station coffee in the United States, these drinks aim to be the most convenient coffee around. They\u2019ll never be great coffee beverages, but what they are is available any time at any place. The electric drip brew is easy to make for gas station attendance, cost them chump change to keep well-supplied, and they have a huge markup value.<br \/><br \/>When we picked up RaceTrac coffee, there were six roasts \u2018freshly\u2019 brewed for the choosing. This is considerably more roasts at the ready for customers than you will find at your local coffeehouse.<br \/><br \/>They supply all the accouterments that come standard at a gas station. You can grab artificial sweeteners, sugar, so-called cream, flavored cream, et cetera. Hey, Krispy Kreme donuts are in the cabinet next to the coffee. If that\u2019s not convenient, what is?<br \/><br \/>Of course, the coffee there tastes poorly. Neither of us drank more than four swallows of our cups. They didn\u2019t smell right either. Stale bread crumbs from a dirty countertop came to Joe\u2019s mind as he took his first sip. Eric likened the aroma to dirty socks.<br \/><br \/>But gas station coffee serves its purpose in America. There are many of us that don\u2019t have the time or budget for fussier coffee from Starbucks, let alone a Keurig or a craft coffee maker like a French press. Many people are getting up at 4 AM and have a long drive ahead of them to work, with a routine of stopping at the gas station along the way.<br \/><br \/>Their quick-and-dirty solution to coffee meets a real need for many people with an on-the-go lifestyle. If you care about convenience, then they have the caffeine kick to boot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Difference Between Fast and Craft Goods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric points out that this is a product that is made for a specific type of customer and coffee drinker. No one coffee product is the solution for them all.<br \/><br \/>Just as it is for the beer market, you have cheap and convenient drinks for the masses and you have fussy craft drinks for a few. The majority of people don\u2019t appreciate finely-tuned high-quality goods, like craft beer.<br \/><br \/>To those people that do appreciate the good stuff, it\u2019s really difficult for them to understand the people who don\u2019t. Who wouldn\u2019t want something that tastes great?<br \/><br \/>And for people who don\u2019t like beverages that cost an arm and a leg, they look at those who do and shake their heads and despise the idea of handcrafted drinks. What they see is needless toil and extra care and added expense for something that they simply don\u2019t understand or taste in the cup.<br \/><br \/>What they want is what they\u2019ve grown up with, what their parents drink, and what\u2019s familiar to them. Gas station beverages are the most readily available and affordable coffee around, like the bag of pre-ground Community Coffee at your local quick mart or super store. It\u2019s as American as ballpark hotdogs. People highly value convenient coffee. \u201cWhat was good enough for Grandpappy is good enough for me!\u201d<br \/><br \/>But nostalgia will not be enough to keep people hooked on convenience forever. Joe remembers that in his childhood, he often had coffees from gas stations when he\u2019d go out late to work with his dad. No amount of fond memories or familiarity with gas station beverages will keep Joe\u2019s loyalty today.<br \/><br \/>Every year that goes by, more people take notice of the craft coffee movement. People can tell subtly that there\u2019s something qualitatively unique and appealing. Quick and convenient coffee drinkers may not switch from RaceTrac to Blue Bottle, but they\u2019ll probably start to appreciate the coffee that\u2019s a little better.<br \/><br \/>Even K-cup coffee, over gas station coffee, is a huge leap of progress for some coffee drinkers in America today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"Top Brew, Episode 61: Don't Flush Out Your Lightbulbs\" src=\"http:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/54a7010be4b0421d698ff309\/t\/5700384322482eac525b1503\/1459632219311\/?format=1000w\" \/><\/p>","showSlug":"topbrew","title":"Don\u2019t Flush Out Your Lightbulbs"},"62":{"description":"This week on the show, Eric and I discuss \u2018The South - Home of Many a Great \r\nSoft Drink Company\u2019.

The combination of Mountain Dew and whiskey reminded Eric that, back in the day, he drank shots of tequila with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gardenandfarmtractorparts.com\/vw-classic-bug\/wink-soda.html\" title=\"Not much online about Wink, but there's this.\">Wink Soda<\/a> (a primarily grapefruit beverage). Pour some tequila, add some Wink, slam the glass on the table and the drink would transform into a tasty foam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Moxie\u2019s flavor profile is unusual compared to many other caramel-colored soft drinks in the United States. A little about the beverage from Wikipedia:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<em>Moxie\u2019s flavor is unique, as it is not as sweet as most modern soft drinks and is described by some as bitter. Moxie is flavored with <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gentiana\" title=\"About gentian root extract on Wikipedia\">gentian root extract<\/a>, an extremely bitter substance which was reputed to possess medicinal properties. It originated around 1876 as a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Patent_medicine\" title=\"About patent medicine on Wikipedia\">patent medicine<\/a> called \u201cMoxie Nerve Food\u201d.<\/em><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Eric agrees that it\u2019s on the bitter side, and it\u2019s refreshing to find a tasteful soda that\u2019s light on sugar. Like many other small soft drink companies of its ilk in the U.S., Moxie doesn\u2019t fight to keep up with the times; it feels like a product of another era that survives today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Joe\u2019s grandparents on his mother\u2019s side were from North Carolina. Each visit to Greensboro, Joe and his siblings would enjoy Cheerwine. Oddly, this beverage wasn\u2019t sold outside of the Carolinas till recent years. Along with expanding the company, the original recipe was updated with high fructose corn syrup in the place of regular white sugar. Joe is very partial to the sugar-flavored type, which can still be found in glass bottles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Trumanade is the now the all but forgotten concoction Joe\u2019s grandfather made. Once upon a time, Truman Darnell came into possession of lots of sugar for some work he\u2019d done (instead of cash, sugar was exchanged for his labor). Truman used the sugar to create Trumanade, a lemonade-inspired carbonated beverage. When the sugar was all gone the beverage was discontinued. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>No one in the family saved a sample of the product, but family recalls that it was quite good. About 1,000-2,000 bottles were made and sold in Georgia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Adventures in Tea<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to connections in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=meatspace\" title=\"What is 'meatspace'\">meatspace<\/a>, Eric and his wife took a tour of Connie\u2019s Zen Tea facility. Much like the world of coffee, craft tea is a delight for enthusiasts to explore. There\u2019s literally hundreds of flavors to brew from because just a few leaves are processed countless ways to yield different flavors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Eric discovered that he enjoys white tea a little more than green tea. Between the two, white tea tastes less like grass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In his home brewing routine, Eric makes space between cups of coffee to have a tea with his wife in the evening. Tea\u2019s caffeine levels can be as significant as coffee\u2019s, but another element of tea produces a calming effect that counter balances the energy boost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ezentea.com\" title=\"Zen Tea\u2019s web store\">eZenTea.com<\/a> is the online home of Connie\u2019s tea house that Eric toured. Check them out.

They\u2019re pricey, but if you want a tea beverage to go, they\u2019re drinks are comparable to Starbucks\u2019 specialty prices. Go in and ask a specialists to introduce you to their selections, and be sure to enjoy the free aroma. You\u2019ll thank us later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Another Great Coffee House in Downtown Atlanta<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When in downtown near Georgia Tech, be sure to stop and enjoy the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.condesacoffee.com\" title=\"Their site\">Condesa Coffee<\/a> shop. Joe was in town for a conference at the Loudermilk Center a block away from the coffee house. It was well-worth the coffee run to get Joe and his friends freshly roasted\/brewed pour-over, drip and hot chocolate beverages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things that money can buy at a specialty coffee shop is a bag of freshly roasted beans. Condesa takes advantage of the local Counter Culture Coffee company (CCC), a wholesale business that roasts and ships from Atlanta. We\u2019ve mentioned before that we\u2019re super fans of CCC, so Joe was quick to buy whatever beans CCC stocks at Condesa. On April 13, he purchased a 12 oz. box of Justina Ramos, a Bolivian single-farmer lot. It was roasted April 11.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Taste Test of Counter Culture\u2019s Bolivian Coffee<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Eric and I agree that the Counter Culture Coffee Justina Ramos\u2019 packaging stands out. The beans come inside a clear valve-breathing plastic bag inside of a simple cardboard box. The box gives the product a lot of its character. Eric noted that on the shelf it looks like a small box of cereal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t have the tacky branding and marketing design of your average box of Kellogg\u2019s. The Justina Ramos\u2019 packaging is so good, in fact, that I (Joe) could imagine why some coffee enthusiasts would like to collect Counter Culture boxes for display. Justina Ramos\u2019 is colorful. It sports a blue top, red and mediterranean blue label that wraps the front and right side, an elegant off-white background pattern covering four sides, the logo cleverly mirrored on the back, red on the interior\u2026 If you don\u2019t have an air-sealed container for your beans, this package will at least look fabulous with the rest of your coffee gear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Counter Culture\u2019s cupping notes on the box for the <a href=\"https:\/\/counterculturecoffee.com\/store\/coffee\/justina-ramos\" title=\"Check it out on the roaster\u2019s site\">Justina Ramos<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<em>Justina Ramos continues to produce one of our best Bolivian coffees on her nearly 6-hectare farm growing primarily Typica variety plants. A member of the Cenaproc cooperative in the community of Nueva Liusta, Ramos meticulously manages production\u2014from the picking of coffee cherries to the creation of this spectacular lot. We\u2019re fortunate to share Justina\u2019s coffee again and celebrate our continued partnership. Look for flavors of pear, green apple, and almond.<\/em><br \/><em>Variety: Typica &amp; Catura<\/em><br \/><em>Elevation: 1,720 meters<\/em><br \/><em>Post-harvest process: Fermented for 18-22 hours and then washed<\/em><br \/><em>Drying: Dried on raised beds<\/em><br \/><em>Harvest time: June-October 2015<\/em>  <\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I noticed that Justina Ramos tastes a little better as a pour-over in a <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1MybXsg\" title=\"Available on Amazon\">Kalita Wave<\/a> than as an inverted AeroPress brew.

What\u2019s even more uncertain is going it alone: being a developer with an app that\u2019s responsible for your livelihood.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But fortune and sustainability is made every day from the sell of productivity apps. Clever apps, like <a href=\"https:\/\/red-sweater.com\/marsedit\/\" title=\"Check out the app at the developer's site\">MarsEdit<\/a>, were far ahead of their time, which help them find a loyal user base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t the story of Brent Simmons, the creator of MarsEdit. This is the story of and lessons learned by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/danielpunkass\" title=\"@danialpunkass on Twitter\">Daniel Jalkut<\/a>, the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/red-sweater.com\/about\/\" title=\"About Daniel\u2019s company\">Red Sweater Software<\/a>. Daniel started working for Apple at the age of 18, later went to college to study music, then later became the independent developer that took ownership of MarsEdit. This one app has been responsible for his paycheck for the last nine years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Not a Story You Hear Every Day<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Joe first discovered Daniel Jalkut on the <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/27-making-software-selling\/id364995753?i=154912501&amp;mt=2\" title=\"Link to Jalkut's episode #27, with host Myke Hurley\">CMD+Space show<\/a> in 2013. For a long time, Joe was aware that MarsEdit was in development and that Daniel\u2019s command center was Red Sweater, but what he didn\u2019t know was that Jalkut is a host of listener\u2019s favorite <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coreint.org\" title=\"Core Intuition\u2019s site\">Core Intuition<\/a>, \u201ca podcast about indie software development for the Mac, iOS and other Apple technologies.\u201d This past April 1, they released episode <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coreint.org\/2016\/04\/episode-226-a-little-bit-in-crisis\/\" title=\"Listen to the latest episode on their site\">#226: A Little Bit in Crisis<\/a>. (Joe will now stop referring to himself in the third person. Hey, everyone, I\u2019m writing the show notes.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s more to Mr. Jalkut than his podcast and the MarsEdit text editor. At an early age, Daniel participated in the tech community, long before the Internet change everything. Out of high school, Daniel was hired for contract work at Apple. Daniel worked for Apple for many years before mustering up the courage to leave his job security and pursue another passion: music. He went to collage and studied the arts <em>before<\/em> becoming an independent app developer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If his journey wasn\u2019t already different from most (first, go to college, then, find a job, eventually create your own projects on the side, if you\u2019re up for it\u2026), he chose to purchase and continue development of the MarsEdit text editor that specializes in desktop blog editing on the Mac. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And while many developers have followed the rush to build cross platform tools, like productivity tools with versions for Mac <em>and<\/em> iOS, with sporty cloud syncing for file management, Daniel has maintained a steady course. The majority of his focus has remained on MarsEdit for Mac.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Lulling a Baby to Sleep with Noise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the early day of the iOS App Store, Daniel\u2019s first son was a newborn. Daniel and his wife read <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/23n7DjC\" title=\"Check out the book on Amazon\">\u2018The Happiest Baby on the Block\u2019<\/a> to learn about the art of rearing a child. From study, he learned that infants do well listening to static noise. The theory goes that static noise is similar to the sound inside a mother\u2019s womb, which infants hear before birth. Many young ones find it soothing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel developed the simple app he named <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/swish-static-noise-visuals\/id289939916?mt=8\" title=\"Swish on iTunes (App Store) for iOS\">Swish<\/a>. With just a few simple features, it presents a static white noise and visual representation, like that of a broadcast television with poor antenna reception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To this day, Swish is a classic example of an app with a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Skeuomorph\" title=\"About skueomorphism on Wikipedia\">skeuomorphic<\/a> interface, which we discuss later in the show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The Urgency of iOS Apps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Like most independent Mac developers, Daniel has been allured to the iOS platform. For many, building iOS products is the obvious thing to do. As a developer, building apps for two platforms sounds more impressive and possibly affords more opportunities than sticking to one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There is a pervasive awareness of the fame and glory that comes with apps that have millions of downloads on the iOS App Store. In 2008, there was a gold rush to build businesses and products for iOS, and it certainly paid off for early app to market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As time moved on, Daniel discerned that the need to build apps for multiple platforms wasn\u2019t the right path for Red Sweater. He perceived that there\u2019s an urgency to create iOS apps, but not necessarily a well-defined and important reason all Mac developers should divide their attention with the addition of iOS projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel has started  more than one app for iOS that he\u2019s chosen not to ship. MarsEdit, Black Ink, Fast Scripts and Clarion are products of Daniel\u2019s dedication to the Mac platform. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If he magically had an iOS version of MarsEdit at the ready with a strategic marketing plan to go with it, he\u2019d jump at the opportunity to grow his business. For now, he\u2019s strategically focusing on the Mac platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Apps for Sale<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Though MarsEdit is his bread and butter, Daniel has a few other apps to offer: <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Black Ink<\/h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/red-sweater.com\/blackink\/\" title=\"Check out the app at Red Sweater\u2019s site\">Black Ink<\/a> makes it easy to download free puzzles from sources on the internet such as the Wall Street Journal and Chicago Reader, and can open \"Across Lite\" files from various other sources on the web. Unlike books or CD-ROMs that come with a limited selection, Black Ink puts you in charge of downloading the puzzles you love to solve.<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Fast Scripts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/red-sweater.com\/fastscripts\/\" title=\"Fast Scripts at Red Sweater\u2019s site\">FastScripts<\/a> is a powerful script management utility. Instant access to your scripts, by keyboard shortcut or menubar.<br \/><p><br \/><\/p>\n<ul><li>Global or application-specific control at the tip of your fingers. You'll spend less time mousing and more time doing.<\/li>\n<li>An upgrade to the Apple Script Menu - a familiar design with many usability improvements and a refined UI.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Clarion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/red-sweater.com\/clarion\/\" title=\"Learn more about Clarion on Red-Sweater.com\">Clarion<\/a> will fine-tune your musical ear. A customizable quiz partner for interval ear training.<br \/><p><br \/><\/p>\n<ul><li>You need a helpful training partner, not a messy interface. Clarion's simple quiz window is a snap to bring up for quick training between other tasks.<\/li>\n<li>Choose the instruments, scales, and octaves that are most important to you. Set up as many configurations as you like and switch between them instantly.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Acquire MarsEdit?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about obtaining and developing MarsEdit, Daniel equates it to a tag team wrestling match:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\u201cIt takes a lot of work to come up with an idea, put in all of the original investment of experimenting with the idea\u2026work out the bugs, come of with a user interface, ship the first version, take the feedback, come up with a way to sell it\u2026come up with a strategy for handling customer support\u2026 And you do all of that and you get 1.0 out the door, and often there\u2019s not much gas left in the tank.<br \/>\n\u201cAnd what was kind of cool about this situation with MarsEdit is my friend, Brent Simmons, had developed it and actually spun it off from NetNewsWire, which was and still is a popular Mac desktop news reader. I think that if that had been his focus and passion \u2014 to move forward with MarsEdit \u2014 he could\u2019ve done a great job with it, but it was a situation where\u2026 I think it worked well for me to come into it with fresh energy.<br \/>\n\u201cI often think back, like, how much did my own separate apps, like Fast Scripts and some other apps that I shipped\u2026 How much did I just get burned out at one point of shipping fatigue? With MarsEdit, not only did I come into it with fresh energy, but I also came into a scene where it wasn\u2019t like it was making tons of money\u2026 But it was an established product and it had passionate users. And that was to Brent\u2019s credit. He had not made it a household name, but like a very geeky household name.\u201d <\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Acquisitions that Thrive<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Something that Daniel has noticed is that many people believe he can\u2019t take credit for MarsEdit\u2019s development because he didn\u2019t create it. It\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t write it from scratch, but his contributions to MarsEdit over the last nine years are significant and shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a heartwarming story: \u2018App Acquired and Not Abandoned\u2019. Daniel notes, \u201cWhen it works out, it can really benefit both parties.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Many a large tech company has acquired smaller businesses to drain them dry of talent, leaving the acquired company\u2019s products to die. Google and Apple have done this several times in the last decade alone. Sure, there are exceptions, like Siri, an app created by a third party that Apple acquired and integrated into iOS. But when we think of startup acquisitions, we usually expect the products they made to fade away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel has cultivated a sustainable community of MarsEdit users, making it possible to satisfy customers with the app\u2019s betterment and long life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Where\u2019s MarsEdit for iOS?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Like most developers that love Apple devices, Daniel believes that iOS has shown great potential and value. At times, he\u2019s dabbled in more than one iOS app, but none of them have been officially released.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel didn\u2019t want to spread himself too thin. This is the main reason MarsEdit is a dedicated Mac app. When tools and platforms evolve around your app, it\u2019s not necessary that you update with them. Why change what already works? Since the Mac app hasn\u2019t suffered, and Daniel hasn\u2019t created more work for himself than he has time for, it\u2019s a win-win to stay focused on one version for one platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start developing for multiple platforms, you need to ask yourself:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When you\u2019ve been a developer for one platform long enough to find stable success, do you have a real reason that\u2019s pushing you to learn and develop for the additional one?<\/li>\n<li>Is it not good enough to be a developer for the platform you already know?<\/li>\n<li>Is the allure of the newer platform so great that you need to work on it?<\/li>\n<li>Is the money so great in the new platform that you can\u2019t pass it up?<\/li>\n<li>Is the money dwindling for the platform that you already know?<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>For Daniel, the answer to all of these questions was no. \u201cIt\u2019s not stupendously easy to make a living on the Mac with software, but if I had to make a guess, I would say that it is easier than it is on iOS for the average person running their own software company.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Experiments on iOS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There was this one time that Daniel started an app that he had every intention to release. Daniel had the idea to build an app that let people artistically customize pictures with frames and filters and upload them to blogs. He thought of this app long before photo sharing was especially popular with the rise of Instagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of his app\u2019s processed images:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.punkitup.com\/2009\/05\/cambridge-6am.html\">The Polaroid<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.punkitup.com\/2009\/05\/warm-day-in-somerville.html\">The stamp<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.punkitup.com\/2009\/08\/my-moonshot.html\">The wanted poster<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>He spent a lot of time and money building and designing the photo editing app for iOS. But in time, he weighed what releasing the app would inadvertently do<br \/> to MarsEdit, and chose to re-focus on his first commitment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Another iOS app that Daniel started was a mobile version of Black Ink. To hear the comical case of unfortunate events that surround it, you\u2019re going to have to listen to the show. (Please note: Be careful what you upload to the App Store.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr \/><p>All of this and much more was discussed on this week\u2019s episode.
